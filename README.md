```

## üéØ How to Use

### Setup
1. **Position your camera** about 6-8 feet away, perpendicular to your swing plane
2. **Ensure good lighting** with minimal shadows
3. **Clear background** works best for pose detection
4. **Wear contrasting clothing** for better tracking

### Recording a Swing
1. Click **"Start Tracking"** to initialize pose detection
2. Position yourself in the camera frame with your golf club
3. Click **"Start Recording"** when ready to swing
4. **Perform your golf swing** naturally
5. **View instant analysis** with detailed metrics and insights

### Understanding Your Results

#### Swing Metrics
- **Ball Speed**: Estimated velocity of the ball after impact (mph)
- **Club Head Speed**: Peak velocity of your club head (mph)
- **Swing Tempo**: Total time from takeaway to finish (seconds)
- **Impact Angle**: Angle of club at ball contact (degrees)
- **Swing Plane**: Consistency and angle of your swing plane

#### Performance Scores (0-100)
- **Timing**: Sequence and coordination of swing movements
- **Balance**: Stability throughout the swing
- **Consistency**: Repeatability of swing mechanics
- **Power**: Efficiency of power generation and transfer
- **Tempo**: Rhythm and pacing of the swing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

## üéØ Best Practices for Accurate Results

### Camera Setup
- **Tripod or stable surface** for consistent positioning
- **6-8 feet distance** from the golfer
- **Hip height** camera position
- **Side view** (perpendicular to target line)

### Lighting Conditions
- **Natural daylight** or bright indoor lighting
- **Avoid backlighting** or strong shadows
- **Even illumination** across the swing area
- **Minimal background clutter**

### Swing Execution
- **Normal swing speed** for best tracking
- **Full body visible** throughout the swing
- **Consistent setup position** for comparison
- **Multiple swings** for better analysis

## üîß Customization

### Detection Settings
You can adjust the computer vision parameters in the code:

```typescript
// In usePoseDetection.ts
poseInstance.setOptions({
  modelComplexity: 1,        // 0, 1, or 2 (higher = more accurate, slower)
  smoothLandmarks: true,     // Smooth landmark positions
  minDetectionConfidence: 0.5,  // Confidence threshold for detection
  minTrackingConfidence: 0.5    // Confidence threshold for tracking
});
```

### Camera Settings
Modify camera parameters in `useCamera.ts`:

```typescript
const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: {
    width: { ideal: 1280 },    // Camera resolution
    height: { ideal: 720 },
    frameRate: { ideal: 30 },  // Frames per second
    facingMode: 'environment'  // 'user' for front camera
  }
});
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working
- **Check permissions**: Allow camera access in browser
- **Try different browsers**: Chrome generally works best
- **Check other apps**: Close other applications using the camera
- **Restart browser**: Sometimes helps with permission issues

#### Poor Pose Detection
- **Improve lighting**: Add more light sources
- **Check background**: Use a plain, contrasting background
- **Distance**: Move closer or further from camera
- **Clothing**: Wear form-fitting, contrasting clothes

#### Low Performance
- **Close other tabs**: Free up browser resources
- **Lower resolution**: Reduce camera resolution in settings
- **Update browser**: Use the latest browser version
- **Check hardware**: Ensure adequate CPU/GPU performance

#### Analysis Inaccuracies
- **Calibration**: The system uses estimated measurements
- **Multiple swings**: Take several swings for better average
- **Consistent setup**: Use same position and camera angle
- **Professional comparison**: Remember these are estimates, not professional measurements
