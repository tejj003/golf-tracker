This is a golf shot tracking website project that uses computer vision to analyze golf swings. The project includes:

- Real-time camera integration for capturing golf swings
- Computer vision algorithms for motion tracking and analysis
- Ball speed estimation and swing path analysis
- User interface for displaying swing metrics and feedback
- Integration with MediaPipe and OpenCV.js for pose detection and object tracking

## Key Technologies:
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- MediaPipe for pose detection
- OpenCV.js for computer vision
- Canvas API for video processing
- WebRTC for camera access

## Project Structure:
- `/src/components` - React components for UI
- `/src/hooks` - Custom hooks for camera and CV functionality
- `/src/utils` - Utility functions for golf swing analysis
- `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/public` - Static assets and MediaPipe models

When working on this project, prioritize:
1. Real-time performance for video processing
2. Accurate computer vision tracking
3. User-friendly interface design
4. Mobile responsiveness for tablet/phone usage
